title: "To Understand AI, I Studied the Human Brain"

![Gudong | 2026-02-05](https://gudong.s3.bitiful.net/weimd/1770301997069_image.png)

Today, I want to share an interesting audio piece with you.

It's a podcast generated by **AI** (NotebookLM) about: **How is our brain structured?**

## 1. Why Study the Brain?

Friends who know me well are aware that I've been deeply immersed in **AI** programming lately.

While delving into **AI**, I inevitably encountered the concept of **"neural networks."** After all, many underlying logics of artificial intelligence reference how our human brain thinks.

In the process of learning, I grew curious:

> Since **AI**'s neural network mimics the human brain, how exactly does our original "biological neural network" work?

I wanted to systematically understand the composition of the human brain. How are neurons connected? How do neural networks function?

But to be honest, the knowledge barrier here is quite high.

If I had to tackle those hefty biological works or specialized brain science books, I'm honestly too **"lazy"** to read them. Those dry technical terms make it easy to go from introduction to quitting.

## 2. My "Lazy" Learning Method

That's when I thought of the learning tool I've been promoting — **NotebookLM**. ([I previously wrote an article about it](https://blog.gudong.site/2026/02/02/ailearn.html), specifically about using it for learning)

Since I'm too lazy to read, let **AI** read it to me.

I found some basic materials about brain science, threw them into NotebookLM, and asked it to generate an **Audio Overview**.

It transformed those obscure biological concepts into a lively dialogue podcast.

In this audio, two **AI** hosts explained it very simply. They helped me break down the core parts of the brain:

*   **Reptilian Brain**: Responsible for instincts, like breathing and heartbeat — our life-preserving underlying system.
*   **Limbic System**: Responsible for emotions and memory, determining whether we're happy or anxious.
*   **Prefrontal Cortex**: The most advanced part, responsible for rational thinking, decision-making, and logic.

## 3. Reflections

After generating this audio, I exported it to my phone.

During walks, breaks, or while doing chores, I'd put on my headphones and listen.

I found this learning method to be **quite efficient**.

Compared to staring at text, through "listening" to this conversational format, I can very quickly build a complete picture of the brain in my mind. It's not rote memorization of knowledge points, but an intuitive cognitive framework.

When you understand the brain's structure and then look back at **AI**'s neural networks, or even think about our daily emotional fluctuations, you'll gain many new insights.

## 4. Sharing with You

I think this audio is very valuable, so I'm sharing it today.

If you're also interested in the underlying logic of **AI**, or just want to understand how that 3-pound "hardware" in your head works, I highly recommend giving it a listen.

No need to sit up straight — just click and play during your commute or when you're spacing out.
