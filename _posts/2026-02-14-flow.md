Today is the 27th day of the twelfth lunar month. Morning shopping with family, market was crowded, but this is what Chinese New Year feels like. Afternoon basketball, evening at computer, browsing Twitter, discovered something interesting.

Cloudflare released a new feature: for websites published through Cloudflare, AI访问时只返回 markdown 数据。

In other words, we humans opened a separate port for AI.

Many people know that when we visit a website, loading a URL actually loads many things. Beyond the content we care about, web pages also load many titles, navigation bars, bottom tags — many useless labels.

For AI or when we browse content, what we care about most is the content area. This information actually only accounts for 20% of the entire webpage.

So for AI, if using traditional methods to load webpages, it wastes many tokens.

Now that Cloudflare saw this problem, they support a new mode: when AI 访问, directly tell it the content, don't return those other information.

I think this is a turning point, or a marker. We humans have started making changes specifically for AI.

## 1. New Productivity Cannot Fit Old Processes

I previously wrote in that article about intelligent agents: during the industrial revolution, when new productivity emerged, if we simply put new productivity into old production processes, it cannot truly unleash the value of the new productivity.

For example, replacing water wheels with steam engines actually cannot release the revolutionary power of steam engines.

## 2. Kuaishou's 3-Year AI Practice

The night before last, I saw a particularly good article about how Kuaishou practiced AI over these 3 years.

[Original link](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Jaz1132eb_bRfo6o4fD8KA)

It's about how AI can better help us with daily development work. I often talk about this — I use AI in my daily work, but from my personal feeling, we just let AI help us generate code, it hasn't really improved our R&D efficiency, made us deliver more requirements, or make better products. AI is really just an assistant.

Kuaishou also went through this stage, and finally found a new direction.

Instead of individuals working harder to use AI tools, they improve organizational efficiency by reorganizing and redesigning requirement delivery.

Specifically, they did three things to implement this system:

### First: Build a platform

They created a product form called Flow — essentially a workflow engine. For the same requirement, developers can choose different development methods on this platform. Kuaishou offers 3 methods: traditional development OK, AI assistant OK, AI pair development also OK.

But the key is: as long as you use this system, use this engine, the key is that context between multiple nodes can be passed automatically.

For example, after AI completes requirement analysis and technical design, the output structured documentation can be directly passed to the AI coding node, improving code generation accuracy. This solves the problem of various AI tools being scattered and disconnected.

### Second: Change practice

They no longer just train individual skills, but redesign processes and division of labor at the team level. For example, a requirement that originally required frontend and backend collaboration between two people can now be completed by one person in some cases, saving collaboration and waiting time.

### Third: Build metrics

They no longer focus on the single metric of AI code generation rate. Our company also keeps watching AI code generation rate, but Kuaishou has stopped focusing on this metric.

But what do they focus on now? They focus on the percentage of requirements completed through automation and new standardized processes, as well as changes in requirement delivery cycles. Ultimately, this can more directly measure AI's actual impact on organizational effectiveness.

## 3. Design New Processes for AI

Actually, these two things — one is domestic front-line team practice, one is Cloudflare's international frontend project deployment platform reform — it's not hard to discover:

Everyone has started designing new processes and new development workflows for AI, including technical output solutions. It's not simply embedding AI into old processes, but developing a new set of processes to adapt to AI, not making AI adapt to our original approach.

This is a transformation. I think this transformation will continue even more throughout 2026.

Including what I told my friends — Kuaishou's practice is very valuable, especially for domestic medium-to-large enterprises and top-tier product R&D processes. The path they walked can actually be applied to other teams and other front-line R&D teams.

What they essentially did was take AI as a new productivity and redesign our product development processes that have been running for ten or twenty-plus years.
