Today is the 26th day of the twelfth lunar month. I've taken leave early and returned home.

The feeling of being on holiday is wonderful. The year is finally done, and my whole body instantly relaxed.

Although the National Day holiday in October is also a break, Spring Festival feels completely different. Spring Festival carries a ceremonial sense of "completion" — that tension inside truly loosens.

In this relaxed moment, I suddenly want to talk about something I love eating — **persimmons**.

Just to clarify: not tomatoes, but those bright orange persimmons hanging from trees.

## 1. The Sweetness of Winter

My hometown is in Gansu province. When I was a child, material goods weren't as abundant as they are now.

In northwest China, persimmons were only available in winter. Back then, when the family went to the county town for errands, Mom would always bring back a few persimmons. Mom loved them, and I loved them too. Later, whenever she went shopping for the New Year, she would basically always buy persimmons.

Back then, there was only one type of persimmon — soft, with very thin skin.

Soft in your hand, incredibly sweet. As a child, I didn't understand sugar control — as long as it tasted good, that was enough. If I ate freely, I could finish five or six by myself.

## 2. The Secret in Aunt's Backyard

Besides fresh persimmons, I also particularly love **dried persimmons**.

It's funny to say, but for a long time, I didn't know that dried persimmons were made from persimmons. My first impression of them came from my aunt's house.

My aunt ran a small shop in the village that sold dried persimmons, but to my recollection, I never properly bought any.

Once, my aunt's family was moving their shop from the front room to the back room. Many miscellaneous items and food approaching expiration were piled into the backyard storage room.

When I went to play at my aunt's house, I inadvertently discovered these "forgotten" dried persimmons in the backyard. They were covered in thick white frost, and some had dried quite hard.

To this day, I still remember all the oddly-shaped dried persimmons. But to a small child, this was simply treasure.

Because they were in the storage room and not for sale, I felt in my heart that this didn't count as stealing, so I secretly took them to eat. For a while, I went to my aunt's house whenever I could, without telling the adults, just slipping into the backyard to satisfy my cravings. Thinking back now, it's quite amusing.

## 3. From Scarcity to Restraint

Growing up, I learned that persimmons actually come in many varieties — crisp ones, soft ones. But the joy seems to have diminished.

When I was young, I never looked at nutrition labels, never concerned myself with sugar content. Now it's different — middle age brings attention to health.

Recently, I asked AI for dietary advice, and it said persimmons have too much sugar and shouldn't be eaten in excess. My wife also frequently reminds me to eat less sweets.

Even so, when I was working recently, I couldn't resist — I'd buy five or six, and eat one each evening after work.

**That kind of unbridled joy has ultimately disappeared along with the scarcity of childhood.**

Perhaps many beautiful memories are beautiful precisely because of the material scarcity of those times. Because they were rare, every bite felt exceptionally precious.

Life is better now, things are more abundant. We've learned restraint, but we've also lost a certain pure satisfaction.

On the 26th day of the twelfth lunar month, eat a persimmon — may everything go as you wish.
